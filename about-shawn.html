          <p>Being a long time resident of Okotoks, Shawn has been involved in music in the Foothills for many years.  Playing trumpet in concert &amp; jazz bands at the Alberta High School of Fine Arts and getting his first taste of conducting as assistant conductor in High School, Shawn continued his musical journey at the University of Lethbridge, graduating with his Bachelor's of Music in Trumpet Performance.</p>

          <p>Shawn has been a lifelong fan of jazz music, both vocal and instrumental, and it was a natural progression for him when asked to lead the group after assisting with it's creation in the Summer of 2016.  He is extremely excited for the future of the Jazz Chorus, the Foothills Philharmonic Society, and bringing more great music to the Foothills.</p>
