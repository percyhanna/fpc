<h1>Notice of AGM</h1>

<p>
  This notice is to provide all members with the notice required by our bylaws
  of our coming Annual General Meeting. This will take place on Tuesday October
  22nd, at the Okotoks Alliance Church, starting at 7:00pm.
</p>

<h2>AGM Attendance and Voting</h2>

<p>
  Please attend the AGM if you are able to do so; it is an important requirement
  under the Societies Act of Alberta that we hold this meeting, and has the
  serious purpose of approving accounts and electing Directors. It is the
  Directors who run the Society on a day-to-day basis and are accountable to you
  for their activities. You will hear reports of our activities over the last
  year and our plans for the future. All members of the Society in good standing
  are eligible to attend the meeting and vote. If you have yet to pay your $20
  Annual Society Fee please do so, this will ensure you are a member in good
  standing. Our Treasurer will happily accept the fee on 22nd if you are unable
  to pay before then.
</p>

<h2>Draft Agenda</h2>
<p>The Draft Agenda for the AGM is attached to this notice.</p>

<p>
  In accordance with the notice sent out on Friday September 17th, 2019 no
  further items may be added to the agenda, and nominations to stand as a
  Director have closed.
</p>

<p>
  The final agenda, minutes of last year’s AGM, and the audited accounts for the
  year to July 31st, 2019 will be sent to you all with a final reminder about
