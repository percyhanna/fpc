            <p>The Foothills Philharmonic Chorus performs works from all periods of music, from Renaissance, Baroque, Classical, Romantic and all the way through the Modern Period. We love singing works by the classic greats such as Mozart, Mendelssohn and Schubert, new works by Eric Whitacre and Arvo Part, and <a href="/repertoire">everything in between</a>.</p>

            <p>The Foothills Philharmonic Chorus is directed by <a href="/about-tim/">Tim Korthuis</a> and accompanied by <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Souliloquy-Ana-Loewen-334634949905052/" target="_blank">Ana Loewen</a>.</p>
